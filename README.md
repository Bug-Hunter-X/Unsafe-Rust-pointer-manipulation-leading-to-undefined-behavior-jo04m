This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving unsafe pointer manipulation.  The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code, which directly modifies a vector's memory using a raw pointer obtained through `as_mut_ptr()`. This can lead to undefined behavior due to potential memory corruption if the vector's internal representation is changed. The solution provided in `bugSolution.rs` demonstrates safe alternatives for manipulating vector elements.
